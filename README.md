This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

It expects to find an open websocket at `ws://localhost:8889`

## Stack

I used `reactJS` with `redux` to manage the state and `redux-saga` to make
the communication with external event sources easier. Also for routing I used `react-router`
